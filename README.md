## About the Project

Using the [beauifulsoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) and [request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) modules the project is created where:
 1. A specific table data is extracted from a wiki-pedia site.
 2. Then the extracted data is stored in a .csv format file.
